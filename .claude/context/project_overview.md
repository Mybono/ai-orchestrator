# Project Overview

_Last updated: 2026-04-08 — added plugins/, new agents, and SKILL.md-format skills_

## Language(s)
- Shell (Bash): `install.sh`, `call_ollama.sh`, `local-commit.sh`, `analyze_project.sh` — pure Bash + `jq` for orchestration — standarts: inferred from existing scripts (no dedicated standarts file)
- Markdown: all agent, command, and skill files — the "code" of the system

This is a **zero-dependency, Unix-native tooling repository**. All logic is handled via Bash, `jq`, and `curl` to interact with Ollama. No Python runtime is required for core operations.

## Architecture & Conventions

- Plugins live in `plugins/` — each plugin is a directory with a `commands/` subdirectory containing Markdown slash commands; each command defines trigger keywords and delegates to a paired agent
- All agents are Markdown files in `agents/` with a YAML front-matter block (`name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`)
- All slash commands are Markdown files in `commands/` with no front-matter — they describe steps to orchestrate agents
- Language standarts are in `skills/` and are named `<lang>-code-standarts.md` (note: "standarts" not "standards" — intentional spelling in filenames)
- Context files produced during a task go to `.claude/context/` — specifically `task_context.md`, `coder_output.md`, and `project_overview.md`
- The full pipeline is: planner writes context → coder generates code → build/type check → reviewer(s) in parallel → fix loop (max 3 rounds) → track_savings.sh
- **Zero Python dependency**: All agents call `scripts/call_ollama.sh` directly, which uses `curl` and `jq` for API interaction
- `install.sh` uses symlinks, not file copies — a `git pull` updates everything without reinstall
- New scripts must be added to both `SYMLINK_TARGETS` array and a `chmod +x` block in `scripts/install.sh`
- Bash scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`; standalone scripts add `set -euo pipefail`
- Arg parsing pattern: `while [[ "$#" -gt 0 ]]; do case $1 in --flag) VAR="$2"; shift ;; esac; shift; done`
- All JSON manipulation uses `jq` — never sed/awk for JSON; `$HOME` not `~` for home dir references
- `settings.json.template` uses `__HOME__` as a placeholder; `install.sh` substitutes it with `$HOME` via `sed`
- The planner agent checks for `project_overview.md` first (Phase 0 fast path) and skips full exploration if it exists
- Token stats are persisted at `~/.claude/token_stats.json` with schema `{"runs": [...]}`
- `track_savings.sh` supports two modes: (1) file-size mode using `--context-file`/`--output-file`, (2) direct mode using `--input-tokens`/`--output-tokens`; mode is auto-detected by whether both direct flags are present
- `call_ollama.sh` auto-tracks every LLM call via `track_savings.sh` (best-effort, silent on failure); uses role name as the task label, falling back to model name if role is empty

## Do Not Touch

- `README.md`: managed exclusively by the `doc-writer` agent — a `PreToolUse` hook in `settings.json` will block direct edits
- `docs/` (any path matching `/docs/`): same hook protection as README.md
- `.claude/settings.json`: generated by `install.sh` from the template — do not edit directly on each machine
- `skills/*-code-standarts.md` filenames: the "standarts" typo is load-bearing — all agents reference these exact filenames; renaming breaks detection

## Known Constraints

- Never mock Ollama in tests: the system relies on real local model responses
- The `debug.md` agent file does not exist in `agents/` — it exists only as `commands/debug.md`
- `quick-coder` uses `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` with a hard 4096-token context limit — never use it for multi-file changes or new classes
- The fix loop in `/implement` is capped at 3 rounds — after that, unresolved issues are reported to the user
- `doc-writer` uses `think=False` when calling `qwen3:8b` — do not remove this flag
- `track_savings.sh` Step 5 in `/implement` is best-effort — skip silently if script not found (not yet installed)
- Float arithmetic in bash scripts must use `jq -n` — bash `$(( ))` handles integers only
- `call_ollama.sh` and `track_savings.sh` do NOT use `set -euo pipefail` — do not add it; callers depend on lenient error handling
